ðŸš€ Data Analysis Project: Customer Ratings and Pricing Trends ðŸ“Š
Overview
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive Data Analysis on a real-world dataset containing customer ratings, pricing, and several other key features. The main goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset to uncover hidden patterns and trends that drive meaningful insights.

I used Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment to explore and manipulate the data effectively. This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Tools & Libraries
Python: Main programming language used.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for writing and executing code.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
Project Highlights
Data Cleaning
The dataset contained messy and inconsistent values. I applied various techniques to clean the data, such as handling missing values and standardizing data formats. Custom functions were written to manage and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I used EDA techniques to dive deep into the data, identifying trends and outliers that provide a better understanding of the dataset.
Analyzed features like customer ratings and pricing to understand the distribution and relationships between them.
Data Visualization
I created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to bring clarity to the data. Some of the key visualizations include:

Heatmaps to illustrate correlations between various features.
Bar plots and Histograms to visualize the distribution of customer ratings and pricing trends.
Key Functions and Features
Custom Functions: Designed functions to clean and standardize specific columns, such as rating formats, ensuring consistency across the dataset.
Missing Value Handling: Managed missing data by applying appropriate imputation techniques, ensuring that analysis was accurate and complete.
Visual Insights: The visualizations highlighted critical insights, such as the pricing trends based on ratings and how different features correlate with each other.
Impact
This project demonstrated how raw data could be transformed into actionable insights, highlighting trends that aid in decision-making. The analysis provided clear patterns of customer behavior, pricing strategy, and correlations between various factors, adding significant value to potential business use cases.
